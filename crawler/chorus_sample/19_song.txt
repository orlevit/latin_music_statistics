I been walking the wire over your love
And they fall into your hands
But I don't know where I'll land
Your body holds me hostage whenever I touch you
I'm a prisoner inside
Baby 'til the end of time

[Verse 2: Usher]
Try to keep my balance but I still fall
But how'd I fall so hard
Right into your arms
Wrapped inside you baby and it's so warm
Love without a cause
Leaves me trapped inside my own bars

[Chorus: Romeo Santos & Usher]
Baby, I want you I need you to love me completely
So promise me you'll never be anybody's but mine
I'll give you my heart girl but you got to promise (Prométeme Mami)
Promise you'll hold me (Hold me)
Touch me (Touch me)
Love me (Love me)
Way past forever

[Interlude: Romeo Santos & Usher]
Hasta siempre
Escucha las palabras de Romeo
Yeah man

Romeo

I know I'm young and I'll give my life for you
And there is nothing that I wouldn't suffer to prove that is true
I try to be calm but my chest keeps pounding
Try to swim but it's like I'm drowning
All I've come for is love, oh baby

[Chorus: Romeo Santos & Usher]
Baby, I want you I need you to love me completely
So promise me you'll never be anybody's but mine
I'll give you my heart girl but you got to promise (Ay, Prométeme Mami)
Promise you'll hold me (Hold me)
Touch me (Touch me)
Love me (Love me)
Way past forever

[Bridge: Romeo Santos & Usher]
You need this in your life, two kings, revolutionary
Without you, girl, I would be barely breathing
I never would survive if you would leave me
But I realize it's worth running a race
When the finish line is you

[Chorus: Romeo Santos & Usher]
Baby I want you I need you pero yo tengo miedo
So promise me you'll never be anybody's but mine
If I give you my heart girl but you got to promise
(Promise that you'll love me, baby)
Promise you'll hold me (Hold me)
Touch me (Touch me)
Love me (Love me)
Way past forever
[Outro: Romeo Santos]
Baby, I want you I need you to love me completely
So promise me you'll never be anybody's but mine
