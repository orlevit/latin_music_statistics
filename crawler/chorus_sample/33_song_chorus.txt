[Chorus: Chris Brown, Prince Royce]
Accept me just as I am
So no one would have to change for nobody
From the ground that I stand (Oh-woah)
I'll give you all that I can with everything that I am
I promise you that I can
Acéptame como soy

Accept me just as I am (Oh, baby)
So no one would have to change for nobody
From the ground that I stand (Oh-woah)

I promise you that I can
(Si te vas puedo morir)
I-I-I promise you that I can
Hago lo que sea por tu amor, I can

The only thing you desire in a man
