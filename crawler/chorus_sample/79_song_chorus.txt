Aquella canción de amor que nos fascina a los dos
The song we always play when we make sweet love
Me da pena, sorry that I have to go
No me digas adios
Sometimes in life you don't get what you want
Me duele mucho tenerme que alejar
Baby girl, you know well you're my boo
Y te prometo que en mi mente estaras tú
Aquella cancion de amor que nos fascina a los dos
The song we always play when we make sweet love
Me da pena, sorry that I have to go
No me digas adios

Tell me that you'll miss me
Tell me that you love me and you need me
Say it, girl, before I go
Dime que me amas
Dime que de lejos que tú me extranas
Dime esas palabras
Me voy, mi amor
Tell me that you'll miss me
Tell me that you love me and you need me
Say it, girl, before I go
