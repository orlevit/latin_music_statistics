Baby, I want you I need you to love me completely
So promise me you'll never be anybody's but mine
I'll give you my heart girl but you got to promise (Prométeme Mami)
Promise you'll hold me (Hold me)
Touch me (Touch me)
Love me (Love me)
Way past forever

Promise you'll hold me (Hold me)
Touch me (Touch me)
Love me (Love me)

Promise you'll hold me (Hold me)
Touch me (Touch me)
Love me (Love me)
Way past forever
