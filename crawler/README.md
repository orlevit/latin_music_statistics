This is statistics regarding Batchata songs.

As a batchata dancer I always searching for a way to improve my dace. One way is to relate to the song.

Since I do not have high Spanish understanding, I used my analytical skills to get insights and answers for the follwoing questions:

What is the most likely word/sentiment/artist/themes, when I have the previous knowledge:
* No previous knowledge.
* If I know the sentiment of the song.
* If I know the artist in the song.

## Data preProcess

# Preprocessing Corpus of Bachata Song Lyrics

The original corpus consists of 1,000 songs, which were downloaded using the "Genius" API, with a focus on the Bachata genre.
Out of those 1000, only 842 remained.
Below are the steps followed during the preprocessing phase:

## Data Collection
- **Source:** The song lyrics were retrieved via the "Genius" API.
- **Genre:** All songs were classified under the "Bachata" genre.
  
## Data Filtering

### Genre Validation
- **ChatGPT-Assisted Validation:** Each song's genre was reviewed with the assistance of ChatGPT to ensure it was correctly classified as Bachata. If a song was incorrectly labeled, it was listened to for verification.
  
### Language Filtering
- **Spanish Word Count:** Songs with less than 98% Spanish words were excluded from the corpus.
  
## Song Annotation

Each song was further processed by assigning two key attributes:
1. **Theme:** A short summary that describes the overall theme of the song.
2. **Sentiment:** The sentiment of the song, categorized as either "Neutral", "Negative", or "Positive".

### Manual Validation of Annotations
- **Theme Accuracy:** Out of 54 tested themes, none were found to be incorrect.
- **Sentiment Accuracy:**
  - Out of 18 songs with "Neutral" sentiment, 5 were misclassified (3 should have been "Positive" and 2 "Negative").
  - All songs labeled as "Negative" were correctly classified.
  - For songs labeled as "Positive", 3 were misclassified (1 should have been "Neutral" and 2 "Negative").

## Data Cleanup

An iterative process was applied to ensure that the lyrics were free from non-lyrical content:
- **Manual Examination:** Multiple phrases and non-lyrical elements (e.g., advertisements or artist comments) were manually removed from the lyrics. This process was repeated until 50 consecutive songs were found to have no extraneous content.

## Conclusions

# General
General Word Insight
The words "querer" ("want") and "amor" ("love") occur at significantly higher rates, indicating a focus on desire and love, emphasizing longing for love.
Predominantly negative sentiment, combined with terms implying change (e.g., "dejar" ("leave"), "volver" ("return"), "olvidar" ("forget")), points to an underlying theme of loss, likely the loss of love.
Understanding the song requires familiarity with an average of 55 words in addition to grammar comprehension.
Artists thinking ("pensar") typically have a ~67% occurrence in songs with negative sentiment; refraining from such contemplation may be more beneficial.
The word "vida" ("life") is used ~63% in songs with negative sentiment, suggesting bachata singers often express negative emotional themes.
General Artist Insight
Only artists with more than 20 songs are included in the analysis:
The five most frequent artists appear in 36% of the songs, significantly impacting vocabulary, sentiment, and themes.
Frank Reyes and Ralphy Dreamz produce a higher volume of negative-themed songs compared to peers.
Prince Royce is recognized as one of the most optimistic and positive artists in the bachata music industry.
General Sentiment Insight
A song is most likely to convey a negative sentiment.
Negative and positive songs exhibit a comparable level of neutral sentiment in their lyrics (~14%).
Some songs demonstrate neutral sentiment, interpreted as either positive or negative depending on the listenerâ€™s perspective; the model classifies them with a high neutral value.
Most "Neutral" songs are attributed to less frequent or lesser-known artists; well-known singers convey clearer sentiments (either "Negative" or "Positive").
General Theme Insight
Predominant themes include "Love and Relationships," "Heartbreak and Loss," and "Toxic Relationships," representing approximately 71% of the corpus, focusing on deep emotional connections and ongoing or concluded relationships.
The theme of "Toxic Relationships" conveys a negative connotation and cannot be interpreted otherwise.
