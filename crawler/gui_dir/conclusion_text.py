        - While the precise meaning of the text may not be immediately apparent from the words alone, the context and sentiment conveyed through key terms like "dejar" (leave), "volver" (return), "morir" (die), and "olvidar" (forget) suggest an underlying theme of lossâ€”most likely the loss of love.
